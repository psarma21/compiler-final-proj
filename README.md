# Project Bashcal

## Introduction
A compiler developed for "Bashcal", a language created by combining parts of Pascal and Bash. While utilizing
existing Pascal functionalities, it adds basic Bash-like capabilities to create an overall powerful language for first-time
Bash users.

## Usage
1. Write a program in Pashcal (let's call it Sample.pas)

2. Create associated Jasmine file:
```
java src/Pascal.java -compile Sample.pas
```

3. Convert Jasmin file to Java class:
```
java -jar jasmin-2.4/jasmin.jar Sample.j
```

4. Run Java class:
```
java Sample.class
```
